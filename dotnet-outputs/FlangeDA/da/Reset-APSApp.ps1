#Requires -Version 7

.SYNOPSIS
  DESTRUCTIVE. Deletes every AppBundle, Activity, and the nickname itself
  registered under your APS_CLIENT_ID (DELETE /forgeapps/me). Irreversible.

  Use this only when Design Automation resource state has gotten confused
  across runs (mismatched owner prefixes, a corrupted nickname, etc.) and you
  want to start over from a clean slate. Not part of the normal deploy/test
  flow — Deploy-And-Test-DA.ps1 never calls this.

.EXAMPLE
  ./Reset-APSApp.ps1 -Confirm
#>
param(
    [switch] $Confirm,
    [int]    $SettleSeconds = 100  # server-side deletion propagation is not instant
)

$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"
. "$PSScriptRoot\APS-Common.ps1"

if (-not $Confirm) {
    Write-Error "This deletes ALL AppBundles/Activities/nickname for your APS_CLIENT_ID. Re-run with -Confirm to proceed."
    exit 1
}
